Formally, let be a directed graph with the set of vertices and set of edges , where is a subset of. For a given vertex , let be the set of vertices that point to it (predecessors), and let be the set of vertices that vertex points to (successors). Hence, the score asso- ciated with a vertex is determined based on the votes that are cast for it, and the score of the vertices cast- ing these votes. When one ver- tex links to another one, it is basically casting a vote for that other vertex. The higher the number of votes that are cast for a vertex, the higher the importance of the vertex.
