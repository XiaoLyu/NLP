Graph-based ranking algorithms are essentially a way of deciding the importance of a vertex within a graph, based on global information recursively drawn from the entire graph. The basic idea im- plemented by a graph-based ranking model is that of “voting” or "recommendation". When one ver- tex links to another one, it is basically casting a vote for that other vertex. The higher the number of votes that are cast for a vertex, the higher the importance of the vertex. Moreover, the importance of the vertex casting the vote determines how important the vote itself is, and this information is also taken into ac- count by the ranking model. Hence, the score asso- ciated with a vertex is determined based on the votes that are cast for it, and the score of the vertices cast- ing these votes.Formally, let               be a directed graph with the set of vertices   and set of edges   , where   is a subset of       . 




For a given vertex     , let             be the set of vertices that point to it (predecessors), and let               be the set of vertices that vertex     



points to (successors). The score of a vertex     is defined as follows (Brin and Page, 1998):
